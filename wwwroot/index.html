                    in the folder you want to create your Svelte Project. Execute the following
                    lines in the terminal

                    With Version 1 released in November, 2016, Svelte
                    has grown to become one of the most well-loved JS development frameworks.
                    In 2021, Stack Overflow named Svelte as the
                    <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021/?utm_source=social-share&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most loved development frameworks. </a>
                    This beat out ASP.NET Core, React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.js. And while excitement,
                    does not always mean easy to learn, enthusiasm in open-source languages
                    means more updates and available components as Svelte continues to grow in popularity.

                    Svelte's community is robust and supportive to new developers.
                    A highlight when learning Svelte is the

                Svelte's beauty is in how fast it is, with Richard Harris, the creator
                of Svelte,
                <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> claiming </a>
                Svelte is basically as fast as vanilla Javacript and faster than Vue and React,
                two of the more popular JS frameworks used in front end web development.
            </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What Marco, Ben, and I found most exciting about Svelte is how Svelte is not only new and fresh,
                    but <strong>relevant</strong> Richard Harris' creation has been adopted by Facebook, Spotify, Apple, and
                    The New York Times. Learning this framework can be critical for anyone looking to
                    break through  in the industry as a front-end web developer.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    No Virtual DOM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When using a framework that utilizes a Virtual DOM, everytime your web application
                    updates, a new Virtual DOM is created and the old DOM is reconciled against the new one,
                    the web application is updated.
                    Svelte skips the overhead of this, seeing the Virtual DOM operations as additional work to be done by the web app.
                    Svelte is instead a <strong>compiler</strong> that knows at build time,
                    rather than run time, what will change in your app. As Richard Harris writes in this
                    <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> article </a>
                    , "...you know what would be even faster [than the additional Virtual DOM operations]? Not using them."
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Simplified Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Svelte is built on the premise of brevity and readability. Harris provides
                    the example of a user
                    <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> adding two numbers </a>
                    in a web application.
                <p>
                    Below is how we program it in Svelte:<br/>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is the exact same program in React:

    </div>
    <div class="sectionContainer">
        <script>

    const reactiveExample = "$: doubled = number * 2";
    const scriptTag = "< script > Insert all JavaScript Here< /script >\n";
    const styleTag = "< style >Insert all CSS here< /style >\n";

    const importComponent = "<ComponentName />";
    const setMeOutside = "<ComponentName setMeOutside = {'This value is given to the component'}/>"
        </script>

                <h3>Reactive Assignments</h3>
                <p>
                    Svelte will automatically update the DOM whenever <strong>any</strong>
                    component's state changes. Svelte has a built in reactive operator that
                    recomputes values whenever any relevant part changes. Take a look at the below code:
                    <div class="codeSnippet">
                        $: doubled = number * 2;
                    </div>
                    The "$:" signifies this as reactive declaration. Whenever the "count" variable updates,
                    the double variable will also update. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Props and Components</h3>
                <p>
                    Svelte is built upon the idea of reusable and modular code. When designing this website,
                    our group would load components into modules,vastly shortening not only the time it takes
                    to write the code,but the amount of lines in the code.
                </p>
                <p>All Svelte components will be composed using the following template:</p>
                <div class="codeSnippet">
                 
                        &lt;script&gt;<br />
                        Insert all Business Logic here<br />
                        &lt;/script&gt;<br />
                        Insert all HTML here<br />
                        &lt;style&gt;<br />
                        Insert all Styling here<br />
                        &lt;/style&gt;<br />
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next you import the component into the desired module, inside the script section:</p>
                <div class="codeSnippet">
                    <p>
                        &lt;import ComponentName from './pathOfComponent/Component.svelte';&gt;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now whenever you need to access the component you can put it wherever it is needed within
                    the main application. This can be on any line in your source code! It is inserted like so:
                    <div class="codeSnippet">
                        &lt;ComponentName /&gt;
                    </div>
                    This will run <strong>ALL</strong> the code from the imported component. This mean you have full control
                    of where the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will be executed in a component based on where it is injected.
                    But what if you need to pass in a value into a component from an external module? This is where we used
                    Svelte Props!
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    Props in Svelte
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In order to pass a value into an external component, you must
                    declare the variable with a name identical to the variable you wish to utilize
                    within the component. Next, within the component, you are accessing
                    you must add the <code>export</code> keyword in front of the variable:
                    <div class="codeSnippet">
                        export let setMeOutside;
                    </div>
                <p>
                    The <code>export</code> keyword lets the compiler know this variable can be set
                    outside of this component. Now return to the application using the component.
                    Declare a variable in the script section with the same name, then pass it into the
                    component like so:
                        <div class="codeSnippet">
                        let setMeOutside;<br />

                        &lt;ComponentName setMeOutside = {'This value is given to the component'}/&gt;
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Moving to our Web Application</h3>
                <p>
                    Our Web Application also heavily utilizes each loops, but thanks to Svelte
                    we can write quick, iterative HTML code. We put each loops directly into the HTML code
                    like so:
                    <div class="codeSnippet">
                        {#each Array for item(item.id)}
                          <br />
                         {/each}
                    </div>
                    This loop can contain any HTML elements within it, allowing you to iterate
                    through an array, all while creating appropriate HTML elements.

                </p>
</li> 
        </ul>

    </div>
